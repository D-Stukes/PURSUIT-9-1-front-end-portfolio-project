         <h3>Why I Chose Web Development</h3>
            <p>I love the having the ability to create a medium that I use and depend on in my every day life.  Whether is it is shopping, paying bills, looking for information or just exploring new ideas. Like practically everyone else, I web pages are an integral part of my life.  So why not innovate instead of just relying on the works of others?</p>

            <h3>Why Chose To Be A Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>I enjoy making things beautiful.  Front-end development allows for exciting ways to present information on my web pages.  Growing up, I was a natural artist, able to draw and paint credible works.  During my career path, I always found myself creating beautiful, artistic presentations. Enjoying this creative opportunity as a Web Developer is one I must embrace!</p>
            
            <p>Still, though I love "pretty", I also enjoy "power". There is another awesome side to web development. Being able to deliver and receive data, update it, store it is just as important as presenting.  This a must-have power for me as a web developer!</p>
